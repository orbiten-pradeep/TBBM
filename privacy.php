policy applies solely to information collected by this web site. It will notify you of the following: <br>
1. What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the web site, how it is used

4. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. <br>

<h2>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</h2>
<p>
We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect 
information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or 
rent this information to anyone. 
We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not 
share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to 
fulfil your request, e.g. to ship an order. 
Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new 
products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.

<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>
In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a 
user is required to give certain information (such as name and email address). This information is 
used to contact you about the products/services on our site in which you have expressed interest. At 
your option, you may also provide demographic information (such as gender or age) about yourself, 
but it is not required. 
During registration a user is also required to give financial information (like credit card number, 
expiration date). This information is used only for billing purposes. 
Cookies 
We use “cookies” on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor’s hard drive to help 
us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use 
a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving 
time while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to 
enhance the experience on our site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally 
identifiable information on our site. 
Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we 
have no access to or control over these cookies. 
</p>
 
<h2>Sharing</h2>
<p>
We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked 
to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 
We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill 
users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally 
identifiable information for any secondary purposes beyond filling your order. 
We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these 
services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to 
provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information 
except for the purpose of providing these services. 
Links 
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the 
content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they 
leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally 
identifiable information. 
</p>
 
<h2>Surveys & Contests</h2>
<p>
From time-to-time our site requests information via surveys or contests. Participation in these 
surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you may choose whether or not to participate and 
therefore disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as 
name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact 
information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for 
purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 
Security 
We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the 
website, your information is protected both online and offline. 
Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted 
and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the 
bottom of your web browser, or looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the web page. 
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time and all updates will be posted on this page.</p>
